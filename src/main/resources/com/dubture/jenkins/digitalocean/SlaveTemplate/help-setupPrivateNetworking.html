<div>
    On this droplet, setup a network interface to facilitate internal communication between droplets.
    Note: this does not effect how the Jenkins master communicates with this slave, that is a separate 
    setting in the top-level "Cloud" settings. Traffic between droplets over private networking does not
    count against transfer limits. This is not a measure of security, private networking is shared across
    all droplets in a data center.
